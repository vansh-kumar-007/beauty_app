## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Upload a clear, front-facing photo** of yourself.
2. The app uses [MediaPipe Face Mesh](https://google.github.io/mediapipe/solutions/face_mesh) (via Python and OpenCV) to detect facial landmarks.
3. Key distances and ratios are measured (face height/width, eye spacing, nose & mouth proportions).
4. Each ratio is compared to the Golden Ratio and scored.
5. A harmony score and poetic message are generated just for you.
6. Enjoy animated feedback — confetti for high scores, hearts and stars to celebrate uniqueness!
